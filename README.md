# RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program

## Overview
This project documents my learning journey through the **RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program**, a 20-week national initiative by **VSD** and **IIT Gandhinagar (IITGN)**.  
The program delivers a complete, hands-on experience in designing, implementing, and fabricating a **RISC-V System-on-Chip (SoC)** using **Synopsys EDA tools** and the **SCL180nm PDK**.  

It is part of **India’s Semiconductor Mission**, empowering students and educators with authentic VLSI exposure—going beyond simulation to actual silicon fabrication (tapeout).  


## Program Vision
To create a **scalable and replicable reference tapeout framework** that can be adopted by academic institutions across India.  
This initiative builds a **proven, reusable methodology** for executing production-grade RISC-V Reference SoC tapeouts using industry-standard tools and PDKs.


## Program Description
- Duration: **20 weeks**  
- Tools: **Synopsys EDA suite**  
- PDK: **SCL 180nm**  
- Execution: Online training + physical implementation at **IIT Gandhinagar (IITGN)**  

The program establishes a full **end-to-end silicon flow**:

**RTL → Synthesis → Place & Route → GDSII → Signoff → Post-Silicon Validation**  


## Project Highlights
- Repository setup & functional validation  
- Custom IP integration  
- Full-chip gate-level simulation  
- Physical design preparation  
- Full-chip implementation  
- Signoff & tapeout  
- Post-silicon validation
